# Munchies

This application is a work test for Umain. The specification is found on [their GitHub](https://github.com/apegroup/umain-work-test-web).

## Technology

The application tech stack mimics [Umain's preferred tech stack](https://github.com/apegroup/umain-work-test-web?tab=readme-ov-file#umains-tech-stack-and-you) in using React, NextJS and TypeScript. Tailwind CSS is used for styling.

## Deployment

The application is deployed on a private Amazon EC2 instance, using Nginx for reverse proxying and PM2 for Node process management.

## Development

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
