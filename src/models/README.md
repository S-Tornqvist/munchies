# munchies/src/models

Contains datatypes defined by the API schema at https://work-test-web-2024-eze6j4scpq-lz.a.run.app/api-docs. Validation logic is provided by [zod](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zod).

For readability, the type definitions are separated from the zod schemas. The types could be inferred, but this way the reader won't have to understand zod to understand the types.
